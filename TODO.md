## IDEAS

- Add an led for each key
  - The leds light up when the note is played -> is fun for chords and midi playback
  - Multiplexed of course
- Add some smart interface to change filter / effects variables.
  - Maybe multiple cheap oled displays
  - Maybe multiple encoders
  - The idea of encoders with surrounding leds is intriguing to me -> maybe control via i2c to reduce pin need and to keep it modular (2x 8bit variable (LED / VALUE))
- Add a pitch shift lever
- Add velocity to the keys. -> figure out how this is done in the industry and in hobby projects
  - If this is possible it would be fun to try to add it to pith shift for vibrato instead of just volume or envelope control.
